    "content": "Imagine it's 1665, and you're Robert Hooke, staring through a crude microscope at a thin slice of cork. Suddenly, you see something that changes science forever - tiny box-like structures that remind you of monastery cells. You've just discovered cells! But wait, it gets even cooler... 200 years later, scientists Schleiden, Schwann, and Virchow piece together the puzzle: ALL living things are made of cells, cells come from other cells, and cells are the basic unit of life. This discovery was like finding out that everything in the universe - from the tiniest bacteria to the biggest blue whale - is built from the same LEGO blocks!",

        "description": "Imagine cells are like LEGO blocks. Just like you can build a tiny car or a massive castle with LEGO blocks, nature uses cells to build everything from microscopic bacteria to enormous elephants. The blocks might be arranged differently, but they're all the same basic building material!"

          "step": 1,

        {
          "step": 2,
          "description": "Look for signs of reproduction",
          "reasoning": "Cell theory says all cells come from pre-existing cells. If we see cells dividing or evidence of reproduction, that's a strong indicator."

          "step": 3,
          "description": "Observe if structures function independently",
